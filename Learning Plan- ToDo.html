            </div>
            <p>This week, I got a lot of work done around robotics, but I didn't spend any time working on current events. I still have homework unfinished, and I didn't work very much on my learning plan. I did not do as well as I had hoped this week, and I have a lot of work to do next week.</p>
            <div class="date">
                <h3>2025-03-21</h3>
            </div>
            <p>This week, I think I accomplished a lot, for the first time in a while, I acually got my tutoring homework done. I still have pqqr homework to do though. That's something to work on for next week. I did spend a lot of time working on the robot at robotics, and I learned a lot of interesting stuff about Java, and driving the robot.</p>
            <div class="date">
                <h3>2025-02-21</h3>
            </div>
            <p>This week, I learned a lot of programming at robotics, and I did lots of tutoring homework. I sent 4 emails to contacts, and I started working on my literary analysis intro and conclusion. I also did my LC2 Reflection. I started brainstorming ideas for my learning plan next learning cycle</p>
		<div class="date">
			<h3>2025-02-07</h3>
		</div>
		<p>This week, I had 2 in- person interviews, and I requested 2 shadow days. I have had lots of growth in LTI, but I need more work on my project. I got a lot of homework done because of the snow days :)</p>
		<div class="date">
			<h3>2025-01-25</h3>
		</div>
			<p>This week, I had interviews on both Tuesday and Thursday, so I think that is evidence of growth in LTI. I also have an interview on the 4th, next Tuesday. I’m falling a bit behind on homework though, so I guess I’m gonna try to get that done tonight. </p>
            <div class="date">
                <h3>2025-01-24</h3>
            </div>
            <p>1/24/25- This week, most of my time spent was catching up on missed schoolwork, but I'm all caught up now, and I hope I get more free time next week. There also wasn’t very much new work being assigned, mostly just a few things to get done. also WITS. I do kind of feel like im falling behind on LTI.</p>
            <div class="date">
                <h3>2024-12-20</h3>
            </div>
            <p>This week, I worked a lot on my Learning Plan, and I'm pretty proud of it for only working on it for like 2 days. Other than that, I had some trouble staying motivated to do my math homework, including my tutoring stuff, despite not having the distraction of a video game. By that I mean I lost my Val account, but I was still just kinda sorta not doing that much. I did make some yummy mac and cheese! I also did my first in- person interview (or rather my second, but my first was me and Tak). Overall, I think I've grown a lot this week, even if I didn't meet my expectations.</p>
            <div class="date">
                <h3>2024-12-13</h3>
            </div>
        <p>This week, I think I did pretty well as far as completing my goals goes, I got 3 interviews, one of them is later today, and I did some work on my project proposal. I want to get my interviews and interview reflections done</p>
        <div class="date">
            <h3>2024-12-06</h3>
        </div>
        <p>This week, I think I didn’t get as much done as I had hoped, I was productive, but I also lost my retainer which cost me $300 which is sad. Overall, good week, definitely better than others. I did fall asleep twice though. Idk what that was about. I also didn’t work on my learning plan or project proposal as much as I should have.</p>
